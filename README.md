## Remember File State

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin remembers the editor state of files
as you switch between them. It restores the cursor position, scrolling position,
and so on. The plugin doesn't do any polling, and strives to only do work when
opening and closing files in order to no slow down the editing experience.

Note that this plugin doesn't currently remember state across sessions.
